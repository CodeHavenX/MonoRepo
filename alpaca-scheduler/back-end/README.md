# Alpaca Scheduler Back-End

## Getting Started
1. Download Docker on your machine. We use [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
   - If you are unable to launch Docker Desktop when on Ubuntu 24.04, try the following:
   https://forums.docker.com/t/docker-desktop-not-working-on-ubuntu-24-04/141054/2
2. For Windows, you will need to edit some setting in Docker Desktop
   1. Open Setting > General
   2. Check `Expose daemon on tcp://localhost:2375 without TLS`
   3. Check `Add the *.docker.internal names to the host's /etc/hosts file (Requires password)`
   4. Apply and restart. This is important given supabase isn't fully compatible with Windows
3. Follow the steps [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/getting-started) to install a local supabase instance.
4. Once you've installed supabase, `cd MonoRepo/alpaca-scheduler` and enter `supabase start` . This will be used for local development.

### Ubuntu Work Around for Docker Desktop
```bash
sudo sysctl -w kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=0
sudo systemctl --user restart docker-desktop
```

## Running the Server
You can either run the server through gradle or through IntelliJ. To run through gradle, run the following command:
```bash
./gradlew :alpaca-scheduler:back-end:run
```
or by using the main function in the [AlpacaSchedulerBackEnd.kt](src/main/kotlin/com/codehavenx/alpaca/backend/AlpacaSchedulerBackEnd.kt) file.

## Managing Supabase Changes

Some useful references: 
 - [Supabase Local Development](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/local-development) 
 - [Supabase CLI Reference](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/cli/introduction)

We are still currently in the early stages of development and are making changes to the database schema consistently.
The recommended approach to managing changes is to perform schema changes locally and to push those changes.
